# M-14-Tech-Blog
I have built a CMS-Style Blog for technology enthusiasts! This app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication. This is a part of the Module 14 Challenge for the Ohio State University Coding Bootcamp.
